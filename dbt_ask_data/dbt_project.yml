# Configuring models
# Full documentation: https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-models

# In this example config, we tell dbt to build all models in the example/
# directory as views. These settings can be overridden in the individual model
# files using the `{{ config(...) }}` macro.
models:
  dbt_ask_data:
    # Config indicated by + and applies to all files under models/folder_name

    # example:
    #   +materialized: table  # Override materialization for models in the example folder
    #   +schema: example     # Override schema for models in the example folder

    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +schema: staging # This schema is used for staging and cleaning data
      +persist_docs:
